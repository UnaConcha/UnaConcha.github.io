Hi there! This is a page to help users get in touch with me. It also can serve as a digital resume and a link for my various social medias. 
Basically, if you're looking to know more about my experience coding, you're in the right place.

### About Me
I am a third year Honors student at Bridgewater State University studying for a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice and Computer Science. I have about a year of experience in coding so far. I've learned Python and am in the process of learning Java. I am also somewhat familiar with html and Javascript. 

I have been working on learning more Javascript in my free time using [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org).
